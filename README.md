## Introduction

The iPlus Framework is a hybrid solution that combines classical programming with a low-code platform, addressing the needs of developers and integrators who aim to create updateable, individualized software solutions. Our mission is to provide an alternative to proprietary systems, offering a platform that empowers users to maintain control and independence throughout the entire software lifecycle.

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, businesses often find themselves dependent on large corporations for software solutions, leading to a loss of autonomy. The iPlus Framework counters this trend by offering an open-source software platform that encourages decentralized collaboration and innovation. By licensing our software under the GPL, we ensure that any solutions built with our framework remain open and accessible, fostering a community-driven approach to software development.

## Features

The iPlus Framework is designed to meet the complex requirements of modern software development, particularly in industrial environments. Key features include:

- **Hybrid Programming Model:** Combines traditional coding with low-code capabilities, allowing for maximum development freedom while maintaining a consistent programming paradigm.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Enables easy extension and customization of the framework to meet specific industry needs, supporting both transaction-based and real-time, time-critical solutions.
- **Declarative Programming:** Focuses on minimizing maintenance and increasing compatibility, ensuring that software changes and extensions can be carried out during runtime.
- **Seamless Integration:** Bridges the gap between ERP and field levels (IT/OT). Bridges the gap between database oriented programming, network programming and unified UI programming.
- **Simulation and Real-Time intervention:** Allows for the mapping and simulation of processes and object states. Advanced system diagnostics during runtime and changing object states via network.An advanced system diagnostics. 
- **Features:** Compositum pattern, network transparent programming, Remote-Properties, synchronous- and asynchronous RMI over network, Object-Persistance, Messages/Alarms, Entity framework, Virtual inheritance, UI-designer, scripting, packaging, multithreading, workflow-engine, report engine, software package management, customization...more on our website

## What you can create with it
- **SCADA:** Out of the box. With PLC-Connections, OPC-UA-Client and OPC-UA-Server
- **DCS, MES:** Distributed Control Systems, Manufacturing Execution System. Use the iPlus-MES repository for a out of the box usage.
- **Custom industrial applications:** Any applications/components can be developed and provided as packages that are managed by the runtime.
- **HMI or OEM Software**: Standalone installations. Software for single board computers.
- **ERP**: On Premise ERP-Software
- **Mobile**: Mobile Solutions
