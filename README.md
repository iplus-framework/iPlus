## Introduction

The iPlus Framework is a hybrid solution that combines classical programming with a low-code platform, addressing the needs of developers and integrators who aim to create updateable, individualized software solutions. Our mission is to provide an alternative to proprietary systems, offering a platform that empowers users to maintain control and independence throughout the entire software lifecycle.

In today's fast-paced technological landscape, businesses often find themselves dependent on large corporations for software solutions, leading to a loss of autonomy. The iPlus Framework counters this trend by offering an open-source software platform that encourages decentralized collaboration and innovation. By licensing our software under the GPL, we ensure that any solutions built with our framework remain open and accessible, fostering a community-driven approach to software development.

## Features

The iPlus Framework is designed to meet the complex requirements of modern software development, particularly in industrial environments. Key features include:

- **Hybrid Programming Model:** Combines traditional coding with low-code capabilities, allowing for maximum development freedom while maintaining a consistent programming paradigm.
- **Component-Based Architecture:** Enables easy extension and customization of the framework to meet specific industry needs, supporting both transaction-based and real-time, time-critical solutions.
- **Declarative Programming:** Focuses on minimizing maintenance and increasing compatibility, ensuring that software changes and extensions can be carried out during runtime.
- **Seamless Integration:** Bridges the gap between ERP and field levels (IT/OT). Bridges the gap between database oriented programming, network programming and unified UI programming.
- **Simulation and Real-Time intervention:** Allows for the mapping and simulation of processes and object states. Advanced system diagnostics during runtime and changing object states via network.
- **Features:** Compositum pattern, network transparent programming, Remote-Properties, synchronous- and asynchronous RMI over network, Object-Persistance, Messages/Alarms, Entity framework, Virtual inheritance, UI-designer, scripting, packaging, multithreading, workflow-engine, report engine, software package management, customization...more on our website

## What you can create with it
- **SCADA:** Out of the box. With builtin PLC-Connections, OPC-UA-Client and OPC-UA-Server
- **DCS, MES:** Distributed Control Systems, Manufacturing Execution System. Use the [iPlus-MES repository](https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlusMES) for a out of the box usage in combination with [iplus-MES-Mobile](https://github.com/iplus-framework/Mobile).
- **Custom industrial applications:** Any applications/components can be developed and provided as packages that are managed by the runtime.
- **HMI or OEM Software**: Standalone installations. Software for single board computers with linux based operating systems (armbian, raspbian).
- **ERP**: On Premise ERP-Software
- **Mobile**: Mobile Solutions.
- ...

## Technology
- Build on .NET Platform: .NET Core, Entity Framework, WCF, WPF
- Serverside without UI: Windows, Linux
- Clientside with UI: Windows. On Linux/Android currently with WINE, but in the future with Avalonia XPF (see library exception in our GPL-v3 license) also on Linux, Android, macOS, iOS and Web-Browser.

## Getting Started
To get started with the iPlus Framework, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
git clone https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus.git

2. **Install a Microsoft SQL-Server Edition:**  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16

3. **Restore a iplus-database file**  
Restore the SQL Server backup file located in the "Database" folder.

4. **Open project in Microsoft Visual Studio:**
  - Modify the ConnectionStrings.config file: Follow the instructions on [gipSoft's documentation site](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=193d292e-df31-405e-a3e9-f1116846bf86#ItemTextTranslationID_d0551cc7-f767-4790-8ecb-8771836ebac7)
  - Compile the solution an set gip.iplus.client.exe as start project.
  - For building ef-models follow the instructions on [EF core tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/cli/dotnet)
  - dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef  (optional version e.g.: --version 10.0.0-preview.6.25358.103)

5. **Execute gip.iplus.client.exe**  
  - Login with user "superuser" and password "superuser" to **start as a client**. Login with user "00" and password "00" to **start as a service**. After starting the service, your local IP is remembered and you can start a second instance an logon as client to establish the Client-Server-Connection. If you have problems, that the Client doesn't connect with the server read the [network configuration section](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=a7424f03-cbff-4f68-90eb-262b3fdcba1c#ItemTextTranslationID_bf788469-8a2f-4a7c-ad78-2710960096dc). For [running on Linux read here](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=9df14383-a4e5-4a3d-81d5-5dccf80d6c4e).
  - *Important: Every time you pull a newer version from GitHub, you should **hold down the CTRL key** while clicking on the [login button in the login window](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/b00675a8-718c-4c13-9d6d-5e751397ac5f?chapterID=ca1a96f0-233d-4e6c-9cfc-d1db683e4be3#ItemTextTranslationID_e24a12c4-649d-4903-abf0-8366ed656ca1) so that your local databases are updated.* Otherwise, the application will not be able to start.
  - ðŸ¤— Have fun trying it out and watch our videos to get started. However, we recommend [online training](https://iplus-framework.com/en?section=Support%20%26%20Training#d57ccb45-9050-41cb-a177-9e8c05028931).

## Limitations
We have a [fork of entity framework core](https://github.com/iplus-framework/efcore/tree/ef_for_iPlus_compilable) that fixes the following issues:
1. Ability to refresh a context from the database
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16491  
This point is problematic if you are working with long-term database contexts and already loaded entity objects and relationships to other objects have to be reloaded from the database. An example would be if you change a workflow on the client side that was already in use on the server side and it has to be reloaded.

2. DetectChanges slow in long term contexts
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/31819  
This point is problematic when you work with long-term database contexts and larger amounts of data, because the system then becomes slow.

3. Reverting changes
https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/14594

If you want to use **iPlus for productive operation** use this release 9.0 fork and **branch "ef_for_iPlus_compilable"** instead of the official nuget packages. Open the [Directory.Build.props](https://github.com/iplus-framework/iPlus/blob/main/Directory.Build.props) file and set **UseEFCoreForkIPlus to True to** include the compiled ef-assemblies.

5. Obsolete constructor public StackTrace(Thread targetThread, bool needFileInfo)
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/80555  
This point is more of an important "nice to have". Pausing threads, analyzing the stack trace and then letting them continue running is used to [analyze deadlocks](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/6a220db6-a767-40bb-bf95-395e4a289881?chapterID=a09687ec-ede3-4cba-827c-478c74b16b1a#ItemTextTranslationID_0b319477-1658-403a-bbac-bb6da719415b) in multi-threaded applications and to be able to perform good [system diagnostics](https://iplus-framework.com/en/documentation/Read/Index/View/6a220db6-a767-40bb-bf95-395e4a289881?chapterID=d45d9a09-c4d9-4cdf-8a83-910c5fdb99ba#ItemTextTranslationID_08c43200-1b1d-437b-9a1b-846d14e820d7) so that you can identify which program parts and objects are responsible for higher system loads.

6. Improved INotifyCollectionChanged Handling
https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/issues/52  
We have a workaround, but it should still be resolved by MS.

7. DataContractSerializerOperationBehavior: Create a serializer with Resolver
https://github.com/CoreWCF/CoreWCF/pull/512  
We have a workaround, but it should still be resolved by MS.
