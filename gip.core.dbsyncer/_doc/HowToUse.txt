DBSyncer how to use
====================================

1. Create your update
------------------------------------
Name shema for version files
dbsync_{yyyy-MM-dd}_{HH:mm}_{author}.sql

{yyyy-MM-dd} datepart replace with curent date
{HH:mm} time part replace with current time when file is created
{author} replace with your developer short name for example aagincic

Example for created file:
dbsync_2018-08-23_10-08-aagincic.sql

Create file into project "gip.core.dbsyncer"
into folder DbScripts/contextfolder

There is two context folders
varioiplus
variobatch

In SQL file is possible to use command GO.
This is useful in case when you in first step create table and in second you wish insert some rows in this new created table.
This can't be done as one single sql query.
Syncer will break this sql file into so many parts as GO statement appers in file and execute each one in order.

Right click on new created file and for option
	Copy to Output Directory
